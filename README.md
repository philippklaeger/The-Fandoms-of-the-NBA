## Meta-Information

* Name: Philipp Kl√§ger
* GitHub Handle: philippklaeger
* Proposed Project Title: THE FANDOMS OF THE NBA

*Note to Lachlan & Hendrik:* there were some internet connections issues at Talent Square today, which is why my video upload and report.pdf were late. Because I managed every other file (including the report.Rmd) in time, I hope that you can indulge my work without grade deductions for this minor delay.

## Grading Information

* Due Date: **June 18 at 23:59**

Submission is via GitHub Classroom.
Your most recent commit that is on the `main` branch before the due date will be graded.

## Instructions for Students

1. Clone the repository to your machine.
2. Update the meta-information above.
3. Work through the sections below to complete the project.
4. Limits:
   * Word Limit in report.Rmd: 2500 words
   * Time Limit for presentation: 6 minutes

**NOTE: Instructors are available for consultation until June 4th, 2021. From June 5th onwards, instructors will not have consultation hours, and will not regularly check the Slack Discussion forum.**

### Data Availability

* As with Milestone 2, we want access to your data.
* Update the file `data/download_data.R` so that we can download your data to our computer and run your code.

### Code

We want to see the underlying statistical code for your project.

1. In the `code/` directory, we have provided three example scripts. Feel free to modify them as needed and add any additional scripts you want to include.
2. If you add additional scripts, update the section below (Instructions for Graders) so we know the order in which the scripts need to be run.

### Paper

1. Write your report in the file `docs/report.Rmd` and knit it to a pdf. The pdf **MUST** be uploaded to the GitHub repository before the deadline.
2. Do not change the section headers, we expect you to keep to that template.

Some tips:

The example text provided shows examples of how to

* Include a figure in the report
* Make a (regression) table from saved results and include it in the report

Use these examples for your own work.
If you want to do something fancier, you can work with fellow students and (occasionally instructors) in the Slack Channel #milestone-03. 

### Slides & Video

1. Write your slides in the file `docs/slides.Rmd` and knit it to a pdf. The pdf **MUST** be uploaded to the GitHub repository before the deadline.
2. Do not change the section headers, we expect you to keep to that template.
3. Record a presentation of a maximum 6 minutes using these slides.
   Upload the presentation [here](https://forms.gle/tJ12bSoNKwQPMPb7A) before the deadline
